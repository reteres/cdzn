　　一个礼拜，花光了身上出来带的钱。和他通夜浪荡在这个迷离的都会里。和他做着玩耍。不过咱们都领会，咱们都是在玩一场场玩耍，不过他不领会我是真的陷进去这场玩耍，在这场风花雪月的玩耍里我必定是一个波折者。而他却长久是情绪寰球里的成功者。
　　回来的路上，想起那些忙碌的挖土机，吊车，卡车。知道由于乌江的梯级开发，龚滩注定将被淹没，但关于龚滩与土家人的故事却注定将流传下来。
题记：“所有的故乡原本不都是异乡，所谓的故乡只不过是我们祖先漂泊旅程中的最后一站。”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——杨牧
Pen and ink is my favourite, since started fighting ink, then I fell in love with pen and ink.
From the moment of falling in love with pen and ink, I get drunk in the pen and ink, finding no finishing.
Part I hid in the sea of ink, to heal, dialogue with pen and ink, and the spirit of dialogue.
Pen and ink, it is part of my mirror, all my joys and sorrows, all escape however ink in the eye.
Pen and ink, is the most noble gift of nature to me, I like to ink, ink treat me as a friend.
I only remember deeply, nice teacher tells this story, is 24 years old, is as a substitute teacher for our first lesson, her first lesson is about the story of "Wolf".
